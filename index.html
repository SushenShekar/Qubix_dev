            requirements in terms of performance, grade, durability, appearance

            <p>
              We are a building company based in the beautiful Holme Valley near
              Holmfirth in Huddersfield, Yorkshire.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proud of our roots, we try to be very Yorkshire like in the way we
              go about our business. Friendly, honest, sticklers for good value
              and with an appreciation for how stunning the Huddersfield
              countryside is. As a business, we would like to contribute to that
              beauty by creating amazing buildings constructed with great
              craftsmanship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a wealth of experience in building and construction
              management, we can tackle small extensions to large new build
              projects. We are happy working with both traditional building
              materials and new construction methods. The quality of our
              workmanship and customer service is without compromise. In
              addition to our in-house skills, we have a network of first-rate
              contractors and professionals. If required, we can provide you
              with assistance with architects, planning, structural engineers,
              costings and project management.
            </p>
            <p>
              You’ll find us easy to work with, honest, proactive in our
              approach and forthcoming with information. Together we’ll create a
              finished building to be proud of.
